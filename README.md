JSON in Java [package org.json]
===============================

# 11/13/2023: Omeda's org.json version
As part of https://omeda.atlassian.net/browse/ARCH-6973 we needed to upgrade our org.json library to a more recent version while also limiting the potential negative impact on our applications. Since Omeda adopted the original library, there have been several changes to validate Strings as well as duplicate keys inside json objects and arrays. Our application in various places uses .getString("key") very loosely. It does not require that an actual string was placed in the object, we just want back a String representation of the data. For example, one part of our code may do object.put("transactionId", 12345) and then later do String transactionId = object.getString("transactionId"). With the older versions of org.json this is fine, with newer ones it throws an exception. We want it to work as it always has. The second piece is duplicate keys. For our purposes we don't care if a duplicate key is set on an object - we just want whatever was last set for a key to be the assigned value. So if I do object.set("key1", "val1") then I do object.set("key1","val2"). object.get("key1") should equal "val2". For us it is particuarly important because we have a large number of client processes using our webservices that rely on this library. More stringent validation on Strings and duplicate keys could break those API calls.

# Overview

[JSON](http://www.JSON.org/) is a light-weight language-independent data interchange format.

The JSON-Java package is a reference implementation that demonstrates how to parse JSON documents into Java objects and how to generate new JSON documents from the Java classes.

Project goals include:
* Reliable and consistent results
* Adherence to the JSON specification 
* Easy to build, use, and include in other projects
* No external dependencies
* Fast execution and low memory footprint
* Maintain backward compatibility
* Designed and tested to use on Java versions 1.6 - 1.11

The files in this package implement JSON encoders and decoders. The package can also convert between JSON and XML, HTTP headers, Cookies, and CDL.

Bug fixes, code improvements, and unit test coverage changes are welcome! Because this project is currently in the maintenance phase, the kinds of changes that can be accepted are limited. For more information, please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/stleary/JSON-java/wiki/FAQ).

# Build Instructions

The org.json package can be built from the command line, Maven, and Gradle. The unit tests can be executed from Maven, Gradle, or individually in an IDE e.g. Eclipse.
 
**Building from the command line**

*Build the class files from the package root directory src/main/java*
````
javac org/json/*.java
````

*Create the jar file in the current directory*
````
jar cf json-java.jar org/json/*.class
````

*Compile a program that uses the jar (see example code below)*
````
javac -cp .;json-java.jar Test.java (Windows)
javac -cp .:json-java.jar Test.java (Unix Systems)
````

*Test file contents*

````
import org.json.JSONObject;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String args[]){
       JSONObject jo = new JSONObject("{ \"abc\" : \"def\" }");
       System.out.println(jo.toString());
    }
}
````

*Execute the Test file*
```` 
java -cp .;json-java.jar Test (Windows)
java -cp .:json-java.jar Test (Unix Systems)
````

*Expected output*

````
{"abc":"def"}
````

 
**Tools to build the package and execute the unit tests**

Execute the test suite with Maven:
```
mvn clean test
```

Execute the test suite with Gradlew:

```
gradlew clean build test
```
